Tool for cutting accurate SMT stencils on a Graphtec cutter (e.g. Silhouette Cameo) from gerber files.  Techniques include separately drawn line segments (no complex paths), antibacklash, drag-knife-angle "training", and multiple passes.  This produces stencils usable down to approximately 0.5 mm pitch (QFP/QFN) and 0201 discrete components, or perhaps even slightly better; but it is slower than normal cutting.


Usage:

A solderpaste gerber file, paste.gbr, and default settings:

  gerber2graphtec paste.gbr >/dev/usb/lp0

A more elaborate command line with linear map (to correct spatial miscalibration) and multiple passes with different speeds and forces:

  gerber2graphtec --offset 3,4 --matrix 1.001,0,-0.0005,0.9985 --speed 2,1 --force 5,25 paste.gbr >/dev/usb/lp0

You may want to have your CAM tool shrink the paste features by about 2 mils before exporting to gerber.  The craft-cutter knife, when cutting thin mylar, seems to spread out the geometry by about this amount.  I'd suggest using mylar with thickness between about 3 and 5 mils; the IPC-recommended thicknesses for fine-pitch stencils are approximately in this range.  (Typical inexpensive laser-transparency sheets happen to be just right, being somewhere between 3.5 and 4.3 mils.)

Her cutter seems to be quite a bit better than mine was out of the box.  With Silhouette's default software my 0.5 mm pitch pads were distorted to the point of unusability.
